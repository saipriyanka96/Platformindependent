Why Java known to be as platform independent language?

Platform independent is also known as Platform Neutral which means we can write and run the 
code at any supporting operating system. A programmer need to write his/her code at once, 
compile it for one time and then he/she can execute it anywhere they want. That why it is 
sloganed by "Write Once,Run Anywhere".
